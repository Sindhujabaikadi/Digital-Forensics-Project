# Network Pattern Analyzer:   Visualizing Network Traffic Dynamics through  Heatmaps using Wireshark 
The realm of digital forensics is essential for understanding and analyzing the complexities of 
network interactions, particularly in our increasingly digital world where cybersecurity threats 
loom large. In this context, our project introduces the "Network Pattern Analyzer," an advanced 
tool developed to dissect and visualize network traffic to enhance digital security measures. 
This tool employs Python to scrutinize data captured in PCAP/PCAPNG formats, leveraging 
the robust features of Wireshark for in-depth network analysis. 
Wireshark, a renowned network protocol analyzer, plays a pivotal role in this project, enabling 
the capture and examination of real-time data flowing across networks. This capability is 
crucial for professionals in network management, cybersecurity, and forensic analysis, as it 
aids in identifying anomalies, understanding normal network behavior, and investigating 
security breaches. 
The primary innovation of our project lies in its ability to transform complex network data into 
intuitive visual representations specifically, heatmaps. These heatmaps provide a clear and 
immediate visual summary of the data exchanges between network nodes, highlighting 
potential areas of concern such as unusual data flow volumes or unexpected connections, which 
are critical for both troubleshooting and forensic investigations. 
In summary, the Network Pattern Analyzer is not just a tool but a step forward in digital forensic 
technology, offering detailed insights and a new layer of security to network management 
through its advanced analytical capabilities and user-friendly visual outputs.
